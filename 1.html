    <img src="coding img.jpg" width=40%>
    <p style="margin-top:15px">Type of Editor: If you have designers who want granular control over their
      code, you should choose a
      textual editor, but if your designers have limited HTML experience, a WYSIWYG editor may be preferred.
      Scripting Needs: If you plan to only write HTML, you may want to choose a tools specifically specializing in HTML.
      Conversely, if you want to write JavaScript, or other scripting languages, you may want to choose an HTML editor that
      supports other languages as well.
      Integrations: Many HTML editors include integrations with other tools, such as version control software. Consider what
      integrations you need when purchasing an HTML editor so you can ensure you get one that offers them.</p>
